# Minesweeper
### Rules of Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a grid of tiles, each of which may or may not cover hidden mines. The goal is to click on every tile except those that have mines. 

When a user clicks a tile, one of two things happens. If the tile was covering a mine, the mine is revealed and the game ends in failure. If the tile was not covering a mine, it instead reveals the number of adjacent (including diagonals) tiles that are covering mines â€“ and, if that number was 0, behaves as if the user has clicked on every cell around it. 

When the user is confident that all tiles not containing mines have been clicked, the user presses a Validate button (often portrayed as a smiley-face icon) that checks the clicked tiles: if the user is correct, the game ends in victory, if not, the game ends in failure.

### Implemented Funtions

The board is an 8x8 grid and by default 10 hidden mines are randomly placed into the board.

The app supports these functions:
* New Game: start a new, randomly generated game.

* Validate: check that a user has correctly marked all the tiles and end the game in either victory or failure.
